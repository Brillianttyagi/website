        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">Building Materials is a fast growing market in India with major push by the government through schemes like Affordable housing, housing for all & smart cities mission. This is also helped by trends like urbanisation, increasing income levels and a high growth economy. Unlike some products, Building Materials are purchased and used in every city and every village of India.</p>

            <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">However, this market still faces 2 structural problems:</strong>
        </h2>
<ol >
    <li>There are a lot of small unorganised manufacturers with unbranded products who usually sell their products to rural areas and small cities near them.
    </li>
    <li>Demand by market share is controlled by hundreds of small developers and contractors in each city who have no access to better services and have to rely on their local supplier.</li>
</ol>

    <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">However, this market still faces 2 structural problems:</strong>
</h2>
<ol type="A" >
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">E-Commerce</span>  gained momentum as builders looked to online sources for better knowledge and procurement deals. Builders in rural areas as well as small cities gained access to quality branded material for their projects at better prices. This has also helped reduce touchpoints and put more focus on services as market access improved. </li>
<li>Small unbranded players started <span style="text-decoration: underline;">organising their operations</span>  as old channels gave them lesser business over the years. This meant more branded regional companies with less product differentiation.</li>
<li>Total Available Market for each manufacturer became a lot bigger than just their region as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> supply chains improved and access improved.</li>
<li>Services like<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Building Information Modelling (BIM)</span>  and<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement Scheduling</span>  increased with increase in organised construction methods and technology use by larger players.
</li>

            <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">The Future</strong>
        </h2>
        <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">Moving forward, the industry will favor technology over traditional routes, with more focus on services as Product differentiation in the industry remains minimal. The market will also move towards trends like E-commerce and BIM. Branded Players will be at an advantage over unbranded as urban markets grow faster and rural areas gain access to the internet</span>
