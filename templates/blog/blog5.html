        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">According to RedSeer Consulting, the online
            furniture market in
            India grew at a CAGR of approximately 80-85% to reach approximately $310 million in FY19 as compared to $104
            million in FY17, and is likely to have touched $700 million in FY20. But despite this rapid growth, online
            has
            less than 3% share in the overall furniture market which is pegged at $17 billion.</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">The pandemic, over the last few months, has pushed forward
            some
            upcoming trends in the massive and growing Indian Furniture market.</p>

        </h2>
        <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">Once dominated by mom & pop stores, the furniture
            market has witnessed major shift towards organized retail and e-commerce. As supply chains become more
            efficient, the cost for e-tailing and building a multi-channel furniture brand has come down
            substantially. Consumer preferences in metros and tier-I have also pushed shift to organized retail,
            with smaller brands emerging across the country.</span>

            <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">Consumer Preferences</strong>
        </h2>
        <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">As lockdown forced consumers to stay inside their
            homes, the need for comfortable and multi-functional furniture increased. This was duly serviced by
            e-commerce players and organized segment, including the new major entrant IKEA. Consumers, having plenty
            of time in hand during lockdown, learnt more about online shopping and many became comfortable with over
            time, which increased the demand for suitable online portals providing them a convenient and cost
            effective way to buy their furniture. <br>As consumers educated themselves over lockdown, return rates
            have also fallen across categories which has helped many sellers become even more confident about
            selling online.</span>

        <h2 style="font-size: 21px; margin: 20px 0px; font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color: black;">
            <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">Supply Chains</strong>
        </h2>
        <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">As supply chains also strengthened, processing
            orders safely and efficiently became easy, giving a boost to both sellers as well as consumers, who
            started trusting online more than offline retail. With current infrastructure, it became possible for a
            seller in Mumbai to sell to a consumer in a small town in Himachal, which otherwise wouldn’t have been
            possible. Consumers and sellers see this infra upgrade as a win-win where sellers, who have developed a
            good portfolio can showcase their products to every part of the country and the consumer can get a
            product which he wouldn’t find in his own town.</span>

        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 30px;">With continuous improvement in tech and
            logistics, e-commerce
            in furniture will continue to grow as consumers in tier-IV also start trusting the process. Multi-functional
            furniture will gain more traction as consumers look to save space and build their home better. Services will
            also play an important part in e-commerce as consumer focuses more on experience.</p>
