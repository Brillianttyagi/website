        <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">How it works?</strong>
    </h2>
    <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">For any bulk or business buyer, the best available catalog
        is sent as per their requirements from one/various sellers based on several factors including location, price,
        inventory, product reviews, return policy, etc. <br><br> For example, a builder in Surat, Gujarat is looking for
        panel lights, bathroom sinks, faucets and building materials for his under construction site. We will go through
        our sellers for every category and search for which sellers offer most affordable price for a particular product
        and where the seller is based as compared to the builder. This adds some more filters like sellers with
        inventory updated and flexible return policy, etc. and is finalized after discussing with the shortlisted
        sellers. Finally, the quote is sent along with all details and when an order is placed, we deliver those items
        from seller’s warehouse to the builders’ location. Follow up and after sales is done by Seventh Square’s
        Business Team.</span>
