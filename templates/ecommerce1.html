    <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">I recently heard a story about a woman in a tier-4
        city in Rajasthan where she wanted some furniture & furnishings for her house. They got their initial furniture
        done by a carpenter while they were constructing the house and the new furniture was coming to be too expensive
        for the carpenter as it was too small an order. She looked within the city, but couldn’t find any readymade
        furniture worth buying. After exhausting all options, she orders all of it online. It turned out to be better
        quality within their budget. On getting such a good deal, she was even happy to pay for the expensive furniture
        shipping which usually deters people from buying in the metros. After this, she started purchasing most of her
        household items online and is hoping to save enough to remodel her kitchen soon.

    <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">This is usually the story of most online shoppers
        beyond metros. Even in metros, people have experiences of how shopping online has saved them time and money.</p>

        <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">Covid-19 effects on retail</strong></h2>
    <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">The pandemic has given a boost to Home Products being sold
        online. You must have started hearing people buying their Home décor or furniture for the first time during this
        pandemic. Even those categories where people preferred to see, feel and then shop are experiencing online
        traction with the help of many offers from online marketplaces. Furniture & Furnishings, Home Appliances and
        Home Décor have entered the mature online market category where people are much more comfortable ordering these
        categories online, while Lighting, Bath & Kitchenware & Home Improvement e-commerce is growing steadily. Before
        pandemic, around 80 million Indian Households shopped for their Home online, while after Covid-19, it is
        expected that more than 120 million households will shop in these categories online. <br><br> You might have
        heard digitization and e-commerce is the way to go. But how does it really help you as a brand?</span>
