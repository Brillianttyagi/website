        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">Education & Urbanisation play a major part in the consumer's buying process. As India progresses towards an Urban & Educated country, more consumers will start preferring branded products , even in segments where brand doesn’t play a part like Bricks, Pavers, handrails. Why? Because branding helps consumers develop trust in the product and it’s seller. 
            Therefore, Brand Awareness among your target market should be one of the most important aspects of your marketing strategy. Also, brand is an intangible asset and cannot be built overnight. It is built slowly over time and reflects your company’s values.

            <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">Where does E-commerce play a part in this? </strong>
        </h2>
<p>As an effect of Digital India and lower mobile data costs, more Indians now than ever, have started tapping online resources for all their needs. Brands having an online presence have started cultivating certain brand awareness among those internet users. These brands have already gained online advantage over last year due to several lockdowns and now they are strengthening their online resources. 
    Moreover, higher online presence is often equated to better brand awareness and brand value. 
    <br>
    As online consumers increase and more people are comfortable shopping online, the share of e-commerce and organised market will increase substantially even in the highly unorganised Building Materials market.

        </h2>
        <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">Best way to build your presence is through your own website and E-commerce marketplaces for your Products & services.
            Marketplaces help you get access to your target customers and generally carry more trust than a single seller.
