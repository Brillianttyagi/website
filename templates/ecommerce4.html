        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">As our markets grow, more channels & mediums will open up for sellers and buyers to trade in such as physical stores, Ecommerce, social commerce and more.
          With so many channels for consumers to choose for their requirements, brands now have to

            <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">figure out some questions for themselves:

        </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Which medium will give them the best returns on marketing & sales budgets?</li>
        <li>Which medium are their customers moving toward?</li>
      </ol>
      
<p>As the Indian consumer becomes more educated and gains access to resources like the Internet, use of online resource pool will gain importance.
  Any consumer before purchasing anything will research online what to buy, which brand to use, what price is available &  where to buy and the online platform which offers the best service will gain the most share of the consumerâ€™s wallet.
  Online marketplaces, in this scenario, offer brands the best way to reach out to their existing customers as well as potential customers.

        </h2>
        <span style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;">Not only do they offer the consumer a platform to complete their purchases, they also provide allied services such as information & knowledge, consulting, best pairing of different products (included in cross selling), multiple payment options, delivery & tracking, single point customer service for all products, single point installation and other tech services. 
          This makes them preferable to physical stores and single brand e-commerce websites.
