            <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">Cement as a product doesn’t have much
                differentiation across brands. It has a set composition and manufacturers can only vary their product so
                much without damaging the quality. In this case, brands can overcome competitors only through better
                Brand Awareness or Lower Sale Price.

            </h2>
            <p>Since Cement is a bulky product, transportation becomes expensive. Therefore, delivering through multiple
                touchpoints along the supply chain increases the price of the final product and puts pressure on the
                manufacturers margin. Freight costs might add upto INR 50 per bag on retail price of INR 350 or
                manufacturers rate of around INR 270.
                Dealer Discounts, Commissions & Influencer Commissions also add up to more than INR 40 per bag, which
                can be done away with when consumers can buy directly with us.

            <p>Selling online with us is similar to selling non-trade cement without the hassle of having a sales team
                for customers & influencers. On Seventh Square, you can sell your products directly to Builders,
                Contractors, Engineers, Architects & Individual Home Buyers just by creating an account and uploading
                your products. As a manufacturer you can have certain control over the price too when you sell with us.

                </strong>
            </h2>
            <p>Brands should ensure whenever a customer goes to buy cement, brand recall at the moment is high, which
                ultimately ensures higher sales. This is done through marketing and better accessibility to sales
                channels. For example, if the product is available for sale at multiple channels, more likely the
                customer is going to pick it. With Seventh Square, you can access your customer base & potential
                customers who are looking to include technology in the procurement process.
