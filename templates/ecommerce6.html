        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Siliguri', sans-serif;margin: 0px;">Building Materials Market demand in India is segmented into Businesses & Individuals. Individuals are final consumers who are building their own home/office by themselves and hire Architects & Contractors for the same. They require smaller quantities but are huge in total Materials Volume purchased. 
            </p>
        <p>Businesses include Builders, Contractors, Engineers, Architects & other businesses who process the material further. Seventh Square helps manufacturers reach directly to business customers in an organised way along with procurement services.

            <strong style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">Problems faced by manufacturers while selling to businesses : 
            </strong>
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Unorganised Market</span> : Major demand comes from Small & Medium Businesses who usually buy from their local distributors without any use of technology or industry services, due to lack of awareness & options. Seventh Square’s platform can help manufacturers reach out directly to this segment by offering them a complete procurement solution, accessible easily along with complementary services to help them procure efficiently. 
            </li>
            <li><span>Lack of trust</span> : Builders & Contractors are usually not trusted by suppliers in terms of payment. This leads regional manufacturers to adopt a distributor model only, which saves them from dealing with a lot of developers and face huge payment issues. We help you avoid trust issues by dealing with payment ourselves and keeping a single source of payments to you for orders fulfilled. 
            </li>
            <li><span>Competition</span> : Many national brands reach out directly to builders & contractors for their projects. This makes the market inaccessible to other regional brands and national brands who are not able to use these sales channels or spend as much on B2B Marketing. Seventh Square’s Marketplace helps brands reach Business Customers directly without investing any money for this segment. 
            </li>
            <li><span>Geographical Limitation</span> : Many Building Materials are bulky and long transportation distances increase the cost making the brands products undesirable beyond a certain range. By directly connecting businesses, Seventh Square helps you save on transportation costs to distributors & retailers by transporting directly to buyers’ project sites and saving them upto 5-7% on product costs. </li>
